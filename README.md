# **Transistor Current Prediction Model**

This project aims to build a machine-learning model for predicting a transistor's drain current (Id) based on its parameters and operating conditions.

A transistor's Id depends non-linearly on factors like gate-source voltage (Vgs), drain-source voltage (Vds), temperature, and device dimensions. This work develops a neural network model to learn these complex relationships from simulated transistor data.

The goal is to provide a tool that can estimate Id given new combinations of inputs, without relying on complex physical simulations. The trained model could then be deployed for circuit simulation or transistor-level defect analysis tasks.


# **Data Description**

**The data columns:**

**vds** - Drain-source voltage (V) 

This is the voltage applied between the drain and source terminals of the transistor. It varies the operating region between cut-off, linear, and saturation modes.

**L(um)** - Channel length (μm)

The physical length of the transistor channel. Shorter lengths introduce additional short-channel effects. 

**W(um)** - Channel width (μm) 

Wider transistors allow higher currents but also increase parasitic capacitances. The W/L ratio impacts current.

**drain_length(um)** - Drain extension length (μm)

The diffused drain contact region introduces parasitic resistance and capacitance. Longer extensions increase these effects.

**temperature** - Operating temperature (°C)

Higher temperatures reduce carrier mobility and affect threshold voltages through physics mechanisms. Must account for temperature variations.

**vgs** - Gate-source voltage (V)

Controls whether the transistor is on or off. Vgs must exceed the threshold voltage Vt to form an inversion layer channel. 

**vsb** - Source-bulk voltage (V) 

Applying a positive vsb lowers the threshold voltage Vt, making it easier to turn on the transistor. 

**corner** - Process corner 

Categorical variables (tt, ff, ss, sf) indicate how device parameters vary from typical conditions due to process variations. 

**id(uA)** - Drain current (μA) 

The output current passes through the transistor channel from the drain to the source. Strongly depends on the input signal and bias conditions through complex nonlinear relationships.


Here is an example of documentation that could be included in the README.md file of the GitHub repository:


## Model Architecture

Inspired by the physical I-V characteristics, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was selected with:

- Inputs: Vgs, Vds, temperature, dimensions, etc. 
- Hidden layers: Capture nonlinear interactions between inputs
- Outputs: Predicted Id drain current

The nonlinear activations allow approximating threshold and saturation effects observed in real devices.

## Training 

The model was trained end-to-end using backpropagation to minimize mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) on a validation set. Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

Final MAPE is reported on a held-out test set to evaluate generalization performance. Additional analysis and comparisons to other model architectures are also included.

## Usage

The trained model weights are saved in `model.h5`. New Id predictions can be generated by running the inference code.
